				<h2 id="precomputation">Cryptanalysis of Top 512-bit Diffie Hellman Prime</h2>
				
<p>
Our cryptanalysis consisted of performing a precomputation on the
  primes given in two popular sets of weak Diffie-Hellman parameters.
  After performing this computation, we are able to break any Diffie-Hellman key exchange using these primes
  <i>in real time</i>. These parameters are commonly used in <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt>
  ciphers&mdash;these ciphers were <i>intentionally</i> designed to be
  weak to satisfy old regulation standards in the 1990s, and require
  that the prime number used, \(p\) be short (512-bits). This attack is
  only feasible because the parameters are weak.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first is hard-coded in Apache httpd from version 2.1.5 until 2.4.7, and
					is the default group used for <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> cipher suites on 7% of the
					Top 1 Million sites. Across the entire Internet, it is used by more than
					a million HTTPS servers (3% of all HTTPS servers). This group first <a

	        secret keys exchanged using Diffie-Hellman by computing the discrete
	        log of a particular key exchange message in just a few minutes. Furthermore,
	        since the Apache prime is used by a large number of servers, the
	        precomputation cost can be amortized over compromised connections to
	        any of these servers.

	      <h2 id="attack1">Attack I <small>Offline Decryption of Weak DHE Connections</small></h2>
	    	<p>
					<b>Attack.</b> This attack requires that the server default to using a Diffie-Hellman key
					exchange with 512-bit parameters. In this attack, there is a <i>passive</i>
					network adversary able to eavesdrop, who can obtain a transcript of the
					communication between the client and server.
				</p>

	      <p>
	        The video below, recorded in April 2015, demonstrates that a connection
	        to <tt>tips.fbi.gov</tt> can be recorded and decrypted by an
	        eavesdropper. The connection uses the OpenSSL 512-bit Diffie-Hellman
	        group that we have already performed precomputation for. Since the
	        group is small, without precomputation this process would only take one
	        week. With our precomputation, we can break the Diffie-Hellman key
	        exchange in minutes. This enables us to compute the connection keys and
	        decrypt the recorded conversation quickly.
	      </p>

        </div>

				<p>
					<b>Susceptibility.</b> This attack works on most popular browsers and TLS
					libraries. For example, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and earlier, Safari,
					OpenSSL, and JSSE were all vulnerable. Some clients were secure because they
					rejected sufficiently small primes. For example, IE on Windows 10 rejected
					primes shorter than 1024-bit, and GnuTLS rejected primes shorter than
					728-bit.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Prevention.</b> As of May 2015, <tt>www.fbi.gov</tt> has disabled
					all <tt>DHE</tt> cipher suites, preventing this attack. This attack
					can also be prevented if the client (web browser) rejects
					short 512-bit parameters. 512-bit <tt>DHE</tt> is past its prime.
				</p>
                <p>We note that www.fbi.gov was one of a large number of websites affected by the Logjam Attack. While sites need to patch,
                mounting the attack requires non-negligible expertise to mount, and likely has not been widely exploited in the wild.</p>
				<hr />

				<h2 id="attack2">Attack II <small><tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> Downgrade and Offline Decryption of TLS False Start</small></h2>

				<p>
					<b>Attack.</b> This attack only requires that a server <i>support</i> 512-bit parameters,
					but has a greater requirement of the client and attacker. The server, in
					this case, only needs to support <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> cipher suites or use
					512-bit parameters in non-export <tt>DHE</tt> ciphers. The client must be
					using the <a
					href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-falsestart-00"
					target="_blank">TLS False Start</a> extension; that is, the client sends
					application data before receiving the server's <tt>Finished</tt> message in the TLS
					handshake. Finally, the adversary must be an active man-in-the-middle, able to
					intercept, alter, and forward network traffic.
				</p>

				<p>
					The attack proceeds in several steps:
        </p>

        <img class="img-responsive center-image" src="i/falseStart.svg" alt="DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Offline Decryption of False Start Data" />

				<ol>
					<li>The browser connects to <a href="https://www.networksolutionsemail.com">www.networksolutionsemail.com</a> and offers non-export <tt>DHE</tt> ciphers.</li>
					<li>The adversary tampers with the request and offers only <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> ciphers instead.</li>
					<li>The server selects a <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> cipher.</li>
					<li>The adversary tampers with the response so that it looks like non-export <tt>DHE</tt>.</li>
					<li>The server sends export-grade Diffie-Hellman parameters with a 512-bit modulus</li>
					<li>The client completes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and asks for server confirmation.</li>
					<li>The client sends False Start application data before getting confirmation from the server.</li>
					<li>The adversary captures the False Start data, and closes the connection between the client and the server.</li>
					<li>If the client connects again, the attacker lets the connection pass through to the server </li>
				</ol>



				<p>
					At the end of this sequence, the attacker has recorded all the connection
					data, including the server and client's ephemeral public keys. The
					attacker can then obtain the secret key used to encrypt the transmitted
					data, by computing the discrete log of one of these public keys. Once the
					secret key is obtained, the attacker can decrypt the application data. In
					the demo, this allows the attacker to steal the user's credentials.
				</p>

	      <p>
	        The demonstration video below demonstrates connections to the webmail
	        interface of Network Solutions being intercepted by a man-in-the-middle
	        to steal the user's credentials.
	      </p>

        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 text-center">

  	        Your browser does not support MP4 videos.
  	      </video>
        </div>


	      <p>
	        In the video above, computing the discrete log takes several minutes on
	        a laptop. This can be optimized to be much faster, but in this attack
	        scenario, the attacker has offline access to the data, and therefore
	        has no limit on the time to needed to compute the discrete log and
	        obtain the decryption key.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	        <b>Susceptibility.</b> The demo above uses Firefox 35: the last version
	        of Firefox to allow False Start for DHE cipher suites. The attack works
	        for all browsers that use False Start for any DHE cipher suite, such as
	        Google Chrome 41 on all platforms except Linux. Internet Explorer also
	        enables False Start for DHE cipher suites and is vulnerable to this
	        attack, but it only supports DHE with DSA certificates, which are
	        rarely supported by servers on the public Internet.
	      </p>

				<p>
					<b>Prevention.</b> Clients can prevent this attack by rejecting short
					Diffie-Hellman parameters. Servers can prevent this by disabling
					<tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt>, and using strong parameters for non-export
					<tt>DHE</tt>.
				</p>
                <p>We note that www.networksolutionsemail.com was one of a large number of websites affected by the Logjam Attack. While sites need to patch,
                mounting the attack requires non-negligible expertise to mount, and likely has not been widely exploited in the wild.</p>

				<h2 id="attack3">Attack III <small>DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Man-In-The-Middle Server Impersonation</small></h2>

				<p>
          <b>Attack.</b> This attack is an online version of <a
          href="logjam.html#attack2">Attack II</a>. The requirements for the attacks are
          the same, with one exception. In this case, rather than require the
          client support TLS False Start, we instead require the client be
          willing to wait a significant amount of time for the handshake to
          complete. This is because the attacker must compute the connection key
          during the handshake process, but computing the key takes several
          minutes. Some clients have short timeouts which would close the
          connection before the attacker finishes computing the key. If the
          client leaves the connection open for long enough, the attacker is
          able to fully impersonate the server to the client.
        </p>

        <img class="img-responsive center-image" src="i/dhead.svg" alt="DHE_EXPORT Downgrade and Man-In-The-Middle Server Impersonation" />

        <p>
          The attack proceeds as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>The curl client connects to <a href="https://www.tcl.tk">www.tcl.tk</a> and offers at least one <tt>DHE</tt> cipher, but does not offer any <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> ciphers.</li>
          <li>The attacker tampers with the request and offers only <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> ciphers.</li>
          <li>The server selects a <tt>DHE_EXPORT</tt> cipher.</li>
          <li>The MitM attacker tampers with the response so that it looks like a non-export <tt>DHE</tt> cipher.</li>
          <li>The server sends export-grade Diffie-Hellman parameters with a 512-bit modulus</li>
          <li>The attacker reads the server's public Diffie-Hellman key and starts computing its discrete log.</li>
          <li>The attacker gracefully closes the connection to the server.</li>
          <li>The client completes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and asks the server for confirmation.</li>
          <li>Once the attacker finishes computing the discrete log, they derive the connection key and forge a confirmation.</li>
          <li>The client accepts the forged confirmation. At this point, the attacker can impersonate the server to the client.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The video below demonstrates a popular unattended installation method
          being used by an attacker to trick a user into downloading and executing
          arbitrary code.
        </p>


            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 text-center">
              <video class="embed-responsive-item" controls width="75%">

              </video>
            </div>


        <p>
          <b>Susceptibility.</b> Computing the discrete log can take several
          minutes. A client is vulnerable only if it continues waiting
          and leaves the connection open while the discrete log is being
          computed. By sending fake TLS warning alerts, we have been able to
          keep handshake connections open for more than 11 minutes in Firefox.
          This is unrealistic, as users will obviously not tolerate a 11 minute
          delay to load a webpage. More realistically, as the video above shows,
          we have also been able to mount the attack on non-browser OpenSSL
          clients such as curl and git. These applications are typically used to
          download batch data, are often launched in the background, and are
          therefore more often willing to wait for long connection times.
          Alternatively, the attack could be implemented against a connection
          opened in the background by an already-loaded webpage. We also note
          our implementation is not optimized, and performance could likely be
          improved.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Prevention.</b> Once again, clients can prevent this vulnerability
          by rejecting short Diffie-Hellman parameters. While forcing short
          timeouts currently blocks this attack, every year hardware and
          algorithmic improvements reduce the time required to compute a
          discrete log given the precomputation. Short timeouts are unlikely to
          prevent this attack in the future.
        </p>
        <p>We note that www.tcl.tk was one of a large number of websites affected by the Logjam Attack. While sites need to patch,
                mounting the attack requires non-negligible expertise to mount, and likely has not been widely exploited in the wild.</p>

        <h2 id="attack4">Attack IV <small>Attacking other weak Diffie-Hellman parameters</small></h2>
	
        <p>
          <b>Attack.</b> This attack is against servers that use
          poorly generated primes, and does not rely on
          precomputation. It was originally published
          by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaeljameswiener/dhshortexp.pdf">van
          Oorschot and Wiener</a> in 1996. Despite this, our study
          found over 150 vulnerable hosts.  Servers may be vulnerable
          if they do not verify that groups have a special form that
          is known to be secure (examples include "safe" primes or 
          DSA groups) and additionally for either client or server
          to choose a short private exponent, a common server-side
          optimization. In this case, an attacker may be able to
          recover a secret exponent using simple calculations.  It
          enables an attacker to decrypt application data and fully
          impersonate the server to the client.
        </p>

        <p>
          The video below demonstrates a connection to a web interface of 
          a messaging system being intercepted by a man-in-the-middle to 
          steal user's credentials.

	        </video>
        </div>

        <p>
          The attack proceeds as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>The browser connects to the vulnerable website and offers a <tt>DHE</tt> cipher suite.</li>
          <li>The attacker relays the request to the server.</li>
          <li>The attacker reads the server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key from the server response, and starts computing its discrete log.</li>
          <li>The attacker relays the server response to the client.</li>
          <li>Client and server complete the <tt>DHE</tt> handshake, and agree on a connection key.</li>
          <li>The client sends a request for a login page, and the attacker relays it to the server.</li>
          <li>The attacker relays the server response to the client.</li>
          <li>The user enters their credentials and the browser sends the encrypted credentials to server.</li>
          <li>The attacker has finished calculating the discrete log and has derived the connection key. The attacker can impersonate the server, eavesdrop and tamper with messages at their leisure.</li>
        </ol>

        <img class="img-responsive center-image" src="i/comma-censored.svg" alt="MITM Impersonation in Weak DHE Connections" />

        <p>
          This scenario is similar to <a href="logjam.html#attack1">Attack I</a>.
          However, because the parameters chosen by the server are
          weak, it takes just a few seconds for the
          attacker to compute the connection keys, without causing any
          user-noticeable delay.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Susceptibility.</b> Clients and servers are vulnerable to
          this attack if they use short exponents with Diffie-Hellman
          key exchanges using primes that have not been verified to
          either be "safe" or be generated as part of a DSA group.  A
          "safe" prime is a prime of the form \(p = 2q+1\) for some
          prime \(q\); a DSA group enforces that the generator
          generates a subgroup of large prime order.  Many
          Diffie-Hellman implementations use exponents as small as,
          for example, 160 bits with a 1024-bit prime modulus as a
          performance optimization.  This is not known to decrease
          security when using "safe" or DSA primes, but when using an
          insecurely generated prime (for example one which has been generated
          at random without testing further properties) this can allow
          an attacker to easily break the key exchange.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Prevention.</b> This attack can be prevented by using
          either "safe" primes or a well-generated DSA group.
          Implementations can also mitigate this attack by using
          full-sized exponents, which are likely to be secure even
          when used in combination with randomly generated non-"safe"
          primes.
