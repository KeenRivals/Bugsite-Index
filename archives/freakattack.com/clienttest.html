					<b>Good News!</b> Your browser appears to be safe from the FREAK attack.
				</div>
				<div class="alert alert-warning hidden" role="alert" id="manual_check" >
					<b>Whoops!</b> Your browser might be incompatible with our automatic vulnerability test.
					If <a href="https://cve.freakattack.com">this link loads without errors</a>, you're vulnerable.

				<p>Chrome for Windows and all modern versions of Firefox are known to be safe.  However, even if your browser is safe, certain third-party software, including some anti-virus products and adware programs, can expose you to the attack by intercepting TLS connections from the browser.  If you are using a safe browser but our client test says you&rsquo;re vulnerable, this is a likely cause.</p>

				<p>If you're curious, your client currently offers the following cipher suites:</p>
				<table id="cipherTable">
					<tr>
						<th>Cipher Suite</th>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<h5><b>Tools for software developers</b></h5>

				<p>Here are some additional tool for developers debugging their applications. You can try our low-level state-machine tests by loading <a href="https://cve.freakattack.com">this page</a> and <a href="https://cve2.freakattack.com">this page</a>.  (If either connection succeeds, your software is vulnerable.)  Additionally, you can see what cipher suites your TLS library offers by loading <a href="https://ciphers.freakattack.com">this page</a>.  (If the list includes any <tt>EXPORT</tt> ciphers, your software is vulnerable.)</p>
