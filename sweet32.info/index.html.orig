<h1>Sweet32: Birthday attacks on 64-bit block ciphers in TLS and OpenVPN</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6329</h2>

<div class="item">
<div class="item-body">

<p> Cryptographic protocols
  like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">TLS</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253">SSH</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/097.pdf">IPsec</a>,
  and <a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> commonly
  use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">block
  cipher</a> algorithms, such as AES, Triple-DES, and Blowfish, to
  encrypt data between clients and servers. To use such algorithms, the
  data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is
  encrypted separately according to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">mode of operation</a>.
  Older block ciphers, such as Triple-DES and
  Blowfish use a block size of 64 bits, whereas AES uses a block size
  of 128 bits.
</p>

<p>
  It is well-known in the cryptographic community that a short block
  size makes a block cipher vulnerable to
  <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/modes.pdf">birthday</a>
  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/623">attacks</a>, even if there
  are no cryptographic attacks against the block cipher itself.
  We observe that such attacks have now become practical for the common usage of 
  64-bit block ciphers in popular protocols like TLS and OpenVPN.
  Still, such ciphers are widely enabled on the Internet.
  Blowfish is currently the default cipher in OpenVPN, and Triple-DES
  is supported by nearly all HTTPS web servers, and currently used for
  roughly 1-2% of HTTPS connections between mainstream browsers and
  web servers.</p>

<p>We show that a network attacker who can monitor a long-lived
  Triple-DES HTTPS connection between a web browser and a website can
  recover secure HTTP cookies by capturing around 785&nbsp;GB of
  traffic.  In our proof-of-concept demo, this attack currently takes
  less than two days, using malicious Javascript to generate traffic. Keeping a web connection alive for two days may not
  seem very practical, but it worked easily in the lab.  In terms of computational complexity, this
  attack is comparable to the recent <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/">attacks</a>
  on <a href="http://www.rc4nomore.com/">RC4</a>.  We also demonstrate
  a similar attack on VPNs that use 64-bit ciphers, such as OpenVPN,
  where long-lived Blowfish connections are the norm. </p>

<p>
  Countermeasures are currently being implemented by browser vendors,
  OpenSSL, and the OpenVPN team, and we advise users to update to the
  latest available versions.</p>

  Our results will appear in the following technical paper at <a href="https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2016/">ACM CCS 2016</a>:

<div class="item">
<h2 id="intro">Block Ciphers and the Birthday Bound</h2>
<div class="item-body">

<p>
The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size <em>k</em>: the
best attack should be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity
2<sup><em>k</em></sup>.  However, the block size <em>n</em> is also an important security
parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the
same key.  This is particularly important when using common modes of
operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>
queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM,
OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2<sup><em>n</em>/2</sup> blocks of message (the
birthday bound).
</p><p>
With a modern block cipher with 128-bit blocks such as AES, the
birthday bound corresponds to 256&nbsp;EB.
However, for a block cipher with 64-bit
blocks, the birthday bound corresponds to only 32&nbsp;GB, which is easily reached in practice.  When the amount of data
encrypted under a fixed key approaches this limit, the security guarantees
of the mode of operation start to crumble.  This problem is
well-known by cryptographers, who always require keys to be
changed <strong>well before</strong> 2<sup>n/2</sup> blocks.  However
it is often minimized by practitioners
because the attacks require known plaintext, and reveal only little
information.
Indeed, standard bodies only recommend to change the
key just before 2<sup>n/2</sup> blocks, and many implementations don't
enforce any limit on the use of a key.
</p><p>
In particular, there are many uses of block ciphers with 64-bit blocks
where large amount of data are potentially encrypted under the same key, such as:
</p><ul>
<li> 3G telephony (UMTS), encrypted with KASUMI; </li>
<li> OpenVPN, which uses Blowfish as the default cipher; </li>
<li> many Internet protocols, such as TLS, IPSec and SSH, support Triple-DES
  as a legacy cipher. </li>
</ul><p>
In all these scenarios, 32&nbsp;GB of data can be transferred in less than one
hour with a fast connection.

<h2 id="CBC">Exploiting Block Cipher Collisions</h2>
<div class="item-body">

<figure style="float:right; margin:1em">
<img src="CBC.svg" style="width:20em" />
<figcaption>
The CBC mode
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
In practice, block ciphers are used with a mode of operation in order to
deal with messages of arbitrary length.
The CBC mode is one of the oldest encryption modes, and still widely
used.  The message <em>M</em> is divided into blocks <em>m<sub>i</sub></em> and is
encrypted as:
<span class="centered"><em> c<sub>i</sub> = E<sub>k</sub>(m<sub>i</sub> &#8853; c<sub>i-1</sub>)</em>,</span>
where <em>c<sub>-1</sub></em> is an initialization
value usually denoted as IV.
We now explain the impact of collisions on the CBC mode.
</p>

<p>
CBC has been proven secure up to $2^{n/2}$ blocks of
messages.
On the other hand there is a simple birthday attack against CBC: after
2<sup><em>n</em>/2</sup> message blocks encrypted with the same key (in the same
message or in different messages), a collision between two ciphertext
blocks <em>c<sub>i</sub> = c<sub>j</sub></em> is expected.  Since <em>E<sub>k</sub></em> is a
permutation, a collision in the output means that the inputs are the
same (<em>m<sub>i</sub> &#8853; c<sub>i-1</sub> = m<sub>j</sub> &#8853; c<sub>j-1</sub></em>)
which reveals the xor of two plaintext blocks:
<span class="centered">
<em>m<sub>i</sub> &#8853; m<sub>j</sub> = c<sub>i-1</sub> &#8853; c<sub>j-1</sub></em>.
</span>
</p>

<p>
With 2<sup><em>d</em></sup> blocks of data the expected number of collisions
is roughly 2<sup>2<em>d-n-</em>1</sup> (following the birthday paradox).
</p>


<h3>Practical impact</h3>

<p>
In many contexts, recovering only the xor between
two plaintext blocks is not sufficient for an attack with a
practical impact.  However, an attack can be mounted when the following
conditions are fulfilled:
</p><ul>
<li> a fixed secret is sent repeatedly; </li>
<li> some fraction of the plaintext is known. </li>
</ul><p>
In this case, there is a chance that a
collision leaks the xor between the fixed secret and the known
plaintext; this would immediately reveal the secret.  More precisely,
this attack is expected to succeed with high probability as soon as
2<sup>s</sup> copies of the secret and 2<sup>t</sup> known blocks are encrypted,
with <em>s+t &ge; n</em>.
</p><p>
In particular, this is applicable to the security of encrypted HTTP
connections, when an authentication token is send with every request.
A man-in-the-browser attacker can generate a large
number of requests, and recover the authentication token, using the fact
that most headers in the request are predictable or even controlled by
the attacker.
</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<h2 id="usage">64-bit Block Cipher Usage on the Internet</h2>
<div class="item-body">

<p>
Many of the most influential Internet security protocols, such as TLS,
SSH, and IPsec were standardized at a time when 64-bit block ciphers,
such as Triple-DES and Blowfish, were still considered
strong.
For example, in TLS 1.0 and 1.1, Triple-DES is the mandatory encryption
algorithm, so all TLS libraries implement it and a vast majority of
web servers support it.  In addition, until we disclosed the
attacks in this paper, OpenSSL included Triple-DES ciphersuites in its
HIGH-security list (it has now been moved to MEDIUM).
</p>

<h3>Triple-DES and Blowfish usage in VPNs.</h3>

<p>
<span class="h5">IPSec</span> Most IPSec-based VPN clients support
Triple-DES for interoperability.  In particular, some versions of
Microsoft's L2TP VPN client
use <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/325158">Triple-DES
by default</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">OpenVPN</span> 
<a href="https://openvpn.net">OpenVPN</a> is a popular open-source VPN solution
originally written by James Yonan.  The <strong>default encryption</strong> for the
transport protocol of OpenVPN <strong>is Blowfish &ndash; a 64-bit cipher &ndash;</strong> with the
CBC mode.  OpenVPN supports two different modes to generate session keys
to encrypt the messages:
<ul>
<li> In <strong>pre-shared-key mode</strong>, static keys are used for all the traffic.
  In particular, there is no limit to the lifetime of those keys.</li>
<li> In <strong>TLS mode</strong>, session keys are generated with a TLS handshake,
  using certificates to authenticate the peers.  The session keys are
  updated periodically, with limits on the number of packets, the number
  of bytes, or a session time.  The default configuration rekeys the
  tunnel every hour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Triple-DES usage in HTTPS.</h3>

<p>
Triple-DES is the second most widely supported cipher (after AES) in HTTPS
servers, with about <a href="https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2016/04/17/february-2016-scan-results-incomplete/">87% of servers supporting
it</a>.
Furthermore, all popular web browsers support Triple-DES. The cipher that
is actually negotiated for a TLS connection is chosen by the server,
based on its local preference order and on the order in which the
client advertises its ciphersuites. Since most modern browsers and servers
prefer AES over Triple-DES one may expect only a negligible number of connections
to negotiate Triple-DES. However, we find evidence that 1-2% of
all TLS connections likely use Triple-DES in CBC mode, as described below.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Firefox Telemetry</span>
<a href="https://mzl.la/2bkLMFA">Telemetry data from Mozilla Firefox</a>
show that Triple-DES is used for close to 1% of HTTPS connections from
Firefox browsers (0.76% with beta 49).  The use of Triple-DES with Firefox 
is slowly decreasing, and peaked with the removal of RC4 from
the list of supported ciphers in version 36.  Indeed a number of servers
are configured to use, in order of preference, first RC4, then Triple-DES,
and now use Triple-DES with Firefox.  Since all modern browsers have
deprecated RC4 between 2013 and 2015 (following
RFC 7465), they will also use
a Triple-DES ciphersuite in this situation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Scanning the Top 1M Websites</span>
We performed a scan of the top 1 million servers as listed by
Alexa using the <a href="https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan">cipherscan</a>
tool.  We
found that 86% of the servers that support TLS include Triple-DES as one
of the supported ciphers.  Moreover, 1.2% of these servers are configured
in such a way that they will actually pick a
Triple-DES based ciphersuite with a modern browser, even though better alternatives are available.
(In particular many of these servers support AES-based ciphersuites, but use Triple-DES or RC4 preferentially.)
</p>


<p>
<span class="h5">Windows XP Clients and Windows 2003 Servers</span>
The Windows Server 2003 operating system does not support AES-based
ciphersuites in its default configuration, although support for AES can
be added with an optional <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/948963">hotfix</a>.  The Windows XP operating system with
security update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/980436">MS10-049</a> supports
AES-based ciphersuites.
If AES-based ciphersuites have not been added, these operating systems support only
RC4, Triple-DES, DES, and RC2-40.  While they are not supported
anymore by Microsoft, they still have some users, and this creates
situations where the best available cipher is Triple-DES.

<h3> Long-lived HTTPS connection </h3>

<p>
An important requirement for the attack is to send a large number of
requests in the same TLS connection. 
Therefore, we need to find client and
servers that not only negotiate the use of Triple-DES, but also exchange a
large number of HTTP request in the same TLS connection (without
rekeying).  This is possible using a persistent HTTP connection, as
defined in HTTP/1.1 (Keep-Alive).
On the client side, all browsers
that we tested (Firefox, Chrome, Opera) will reuse a TLS connection as
long as the server keeps it open.
</p>

<p>
On the server side,
we found that a number of HTTP servers will close the TLS connection
even when it is still active.  In particular, Apache and Nginx
limit the number of requests sent in the same connection, with a maximum
of 100 in the default configuration.  On the other hand, IIS does not
seem to have such a limit.  In practice, many high profile servers
accept a very large number of requests in a single TLS connection.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Vulnerable Websites</span>
For a better estimate of the number of vulnerable servers, we tested
servers from Alexa's top 10k that negotiate Triple-DES with a modern
client.  We identified 11483 different HTTPS servers, and found that 226 of them (1.9%) negotiate Triple-DES
with a modern client.  Moreover, 72 of these (0.6% of the total) also
accept to keep a connection open for at least 800k requests.
Consequently, the duration of the attack is not unrealistic, at least
from the viewpoint of browsers and servers, and we estimate that at
least 0.6% of HTTPS connections are vulnerable to our attacks.

<h2 id="demo"> Attacking Authenticated HTTP over TLS and OpenVPN </h2>
<div class="item-body">

<p>
We now demonstrate concrete attacks against authenticated HTTP sessions even
when they are secured by TLS or OpenVPN. 
First, we identify a few examples of secret authentication credentials
that are repeatedly sent by the browser on every request.  We then 
show how we can recover these secrets using block cipher collisions.
</p>

<h3> HTTP Bearer Tokens</h3>

<p>
<span class="h5">Cookie-based Sessions</span>
Modern HTTPS websites use a variety of methods to manage authenticated
sessions with their clients.  The most popular mechanism is secure
<em>cookies</em> as specified in RFC6265. Once a user has logged in, the
server sets a cookie containing a secret value on the user's
browser. The browser will then send the cookie on all subsequent
requests to the website, implicitly authenticating the user.
</p><p>
Cookies are sensitive, because an attacker who obtains a session cookie
can then log in as the user from a different browser. The cookie acts
as a <em>bearer token</em> that carries the user's delegated credential.
</p><p>
A cookie for a website is normally included in all requests to that
website whether that request was initiated by the user, or a script on
the website, or even by a different website. Browsers sometimes impose
stricter rules for this last category of requests, called cross-origin
or cross-domain requests.  For example, XmlHttpRequests sent from one
domain to another may not have cookies attached. However, cross-domain
requests for images or iframes will still send cookies.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">HTTP BasicAuth</span>
Apart from cookies, there are other mechanisms for a website to
authenticate the user. In the HTTP Basic Authentication mechanism
specified in RFC7617, the browser asks the user to enter a username
and password into a special dialog and then sends this information (in
plaintext) as an HTTP header of the form:
</p>
<pre>
Authorization: Basic dGVzdDoxMjPCow=
</pre>

<p>
Once a user has entered his login information once, the browser will typically
cache this information and use it on all subsequent requests to the server.
Notably, even if a different website creates a cross-domain request to the
authenticated server, the BasicAuth credentials will be automatically sent
by the browser.

BasicAuth credentials contain the user's password and are hence security-critical.
One should only use this authentication mechanism over HTTPS but a number of
corporate websites use BasicAuth over HTTP, under the assumption that their
users can only access the website over a VPN or some other secure connection.
</p>

<img src="Attack.svg" style="width:20em" />
<figcaption>
The Beastly attacker
</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> The Beastly Attack Scenario </h3>
<p>

Our attack scenario, is similar to the setup used in recent attacks on RC4.
The attacker wants to steal some bearer token that is being repeatedly
sent by a browser to a website secured with HTTPS, or an HTTP website
accessed through a VPN. We assume that the attacker can
control some JavaScript on a web page loaded by the user's browser,
either by actively tampering with an HTTP response on the wire, or by
hosting a malicious website that the user is fooled into visiting.  We
also assume that the attacker can observe all the encrypted traffic between the
target browser and the secure website.
</p><p>
We further assume that the data is encrypted with a 64-bit block cipher
in CBC mode (either an HTTPS connection where the client and server have
negotiated Triple-DES, or an HTTP connection though a VPN encrypted with Blowfish or Triple-DES). Suppose the victim is already logged in to a
website and has a session cookie.  The attacker runs malicious
JavaScript code on the victim's browser that repeatedly sends HTTP
queries to the target website server, each containing the session
cookie.  If he sends close to 2<sup>32</sup> queries, a collision is
expected between a ciphertext block corresponding to the cookie
(<em>c<sub>i</sub></em>), and a known block (<em>c<sub>j</sub></em>), containing a known part of the
query.  The collision attack against CBC reveals the session cookie:
<span class="centered">
<em>p<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>j</sub> &#8853; c<sub>i-1</sub> &#8853; c<sub>j-1</sub></em>.
</span>
</p><p>
Note that most of the traffic generated by the attacker is known or
predictable.  The requested URL is chosen by the attacker, and all the
headers excepted the cookie are predictable and can be observed in any
HTTP traffic.

<h3> Proof-of-Concept Attack Demo </h3>

<p>
The attacker code consists of two parts: a JavaScript program that 
sends a large number of HTTP requests, and a network
adversary who processes the resulting ciphertext to recovers a 16-byte secret.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Man-in-the-browser code</span> The attacker code is
shown on the right: it uses Web workers to
issue <span class="tt">XmlHttpRequests</span>, using
the <span class="tt">withCredentials</span> property to make sure that cookies are
send in the cross-origin request.
We experimented with several browsers, and we obtained the best
results with Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Recovering collisions</span>
We captured the encrypted packets with <span class="tt">tcpdump</span> and used a
C++ program to extract the ciphertext blocks (using <span class="tt">libpcap</span>).
In both the HTTPS attack and the OpenVPN attack, each HTTP query is sent in a
separate encrypted record, which contain the plaintext at a fixed
position, as well as some extra information (packet number, padding,
MAC, ...).  Therefore, it is easy to know to which plaintext block
corresponds each ciphertext block, and to align the cookie to a block limit.

After capturing all the traffic, the C++ program sorts the ciphertext
blocks in order to locate collisions.  Since the amount of data is quite
large (hundreds of gigabytes), we use the external sort implementation of the
<span class="tt">stxxl</span> library.  With a NAS storage, sorting the data took
around four hours.
</p>


<h3>Attacking Basic Auth over OpenVPN</h3>

<p>
To demonstrate the attack against OpenVPN, we use a pre-shared-key
tunnel between two physical machines running Linux, with Firefox
Developer Edition 47.0a2 on one side, and an nginx server on the other
side.  Access to the server is protected by BasicAuth, and the user
has entered his credentials.  Using the default OpenVPN settings, the
tunnel is encrypted with Blowfish in CBC mode.
</p>

<p>
We use the Javascript code described in the previous section to send a
large number of requests to the server though the tunnel.  We found
that increasing the size of the request to 4~kB does not significantly
reduce the query rate, but reduces the number of queries required for
the attack.  In our setting, the browser generates about 2900 requests
per second, using several web Worker running in parallel.  We expect
the first collision after roughly
2<sup>32.3</sup> blocks (40&nbsp;GB), <em>i.e.</em> one hour.
In practice, we detected the first collision
early, after only 30 minutes (2<sup>31.3</sup> blocks); as expected, the
predicted xor difference was correct.  The full attack needs about
2<sup>36.6</sup> blocks (785&nbsp;GB) to recover a two-block secret out of 4&nbsp;kB
messages; this should take about 19 hours in this setting.  <strong>In our
demo, it took 18.6 hours and 705&nbsp;GB, and we successfully
recovered the 16-byte authentication token.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Attacking Secure Cookies over HTTPS</h3>

<p>The attack against HTTPS connection is very similar to the attack
against OpenVPN, as long as we have a client and server that negotiate
Triple-DES, and that keep a connection open for a long time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="h5">Vulnerable Websites</span> As detailed above, about 0.6% of the top Alexa 100K
websites support Triple-DES and allow long-lived HTTPS connections.  This
list contains many high-profile e-commerce and banking websites.
</p>

<p>
We use the Javascript code described above,
but we note that with several <span class="tt">Workers</span> running in
parallel, modern browsers open a few parallel connections to
the server and split the requests over these connections.
For our attack, we need to maximize the throughput over a <i>single</i>
connection.  This can be achieved by disturbing some of the connections
so that most of request are send in a single.  In our setup, we used
<span class="tt">iptables</span> rules to limit the rate of all connections except one.
In a real attack, this would be done by an active man-in-the-middle, but
a passive man-in-the-middle can also mount the attack -- it will just
take more time to collect the data.</p>

<p><span class="h5">Proof-of-Concept Attack Demo</span>
In our setup we use Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2 running
on Linux and an IIS 6.0 server
in a Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 Virtual machine.  The default configuration of
IIS 6.0 with all recommended updates offers only RC4 and Triple-DES ciphers,
and will use Triple-DES with Firefox and other recent browsers where RC4 is
disabled.  Moreover, IIS 6.0 supports HTTP/1.1 and keeps an active connection open
for an arbitrary long time.
</p>

<p>
On Firefox Developer Edition 47.0a2, with a few dozen
<span class="tt">Worker</span>s running in parallel, we can send up to 2000 requests
per second in a single TLS connection.
In our experiment, we were lucky to detect the first collision after
only 25 minutes (2<sup>20.1</sup> requests), and we verified that the
collision revealed the xor of two plaintexts blocks.  As seen
previously, the full attack should require 2<sup>36.6</sup> blocks (785&nbsp;GB) to
recover a two-block cookie, which should take 38 hours in our setting.
<strong>Experimentally, we have recovered a two-block cookie from an HTTPS trace
  of only 610&nbsp;GB, captured in 30.5 hours.</strong>

<h2 id="impact">Impact and Mitigation</h2>
<div class="item-body">

<p>
We have demonstrated the first concrete attacks on mainstream Internet
protocols that exploit block cipher collisions. Our attacks can
recover valuable secrets such as HTTP cookies and passwords in under
40 hours. Our attacks impact a majority of OpenVPN connections and an
estimated 0.6% of HTTPS connections to popular websites.  We expect
that our attacks also impact a number of SSH and IPsec connections,
but we do not have concrete measurements for these protocols.  Like
many recent attacks on TLS, such a BEAST and RC4 NOMORE, the
underlying principles behind our attacks were well known to
cryptographers. Our goal is to raise awareness among practitioners
about the vulnerabilities of short block ciphers and on safe ways of
using them.
</p>

<h3>Comparison with RC4 attacks</h3>
<p>
Our attack scenario is very similar to the setup of the recent
attacks on the use of RC4 in HTTPS.  We use
the same man-in-the-browser setting to generate a large number of HTTP
requests, and the data complexity of the attack is comparable.
Our attack requires only 2<sup>29.1</sup> short queries of 512&nbsp;bytes
(280&nbsp;GB in total), which
can be reduced to 2<sup>27.6</sup> longer queries of 4&nbsp;kB
(785&nbsp;GB in total).  
However, these numbers are for the
case when all the data is encrypted within the same session.  Even if
the amount of data sent on a single connection is limited, as long as
the limit is close enough to the birthday bound, we can still mount
our attacks across multiple parallel and sequential sessions, albeit
with a higher data and time complexity.
</p>

<h3>Mitigation</h3>

<p>
The obvious way to avoid these attacks is to stop using legacy 64-bit
block ciphers.  Alternatively, the attack can be mitigated by rekeying
the session frequently.</p>

<p>Concretely, we recommend the following measures to prevent
our attack:</p>
<ul>
<li> Web servers and VPNs should be configured to prefer
  128-bit ciphers.  According to our scans, about 1.1% of the top 100k
  web server from Alexa, and 0.5% of the top 1 million, support AES but
  prefer to use 3DES.</li>
<li> Web browsers should offer 3DES as a fallback-only cipher, to
  avoid using it with servers that support AES but prefer 3DES. </li>
<li> TLS libraries and applications should limit the length
  of TLS sessions with a 64-bit cipher.  This could be done with TLS
  renegotiation, or in some cases by closing the connection and starting
  a new one (i.e. limiting HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive, SPDY, and HTTP/2
  with 3DES ciphersuites).</li>
<li>OpenVPN users can change the cipher from the default Blowfish to AES, using
    for instance <code>cipher AES-128-CBC</code> on the client and
    server configuration.  If they don't control the server
    configuration, they can mitigate the attack by forcing frequent
    rekeying with <code>reneg-bytes 64000000</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Responsible disclosure</h3>

<p>
We have communicated our results and concerns to the OpenVPN team, and
to various website owners, browser vendors, and TLS libraries.  They all
acknowledged the
issue, and are working on implementing countermeasures.  The TLS
vulnerability received CVE number CVE-2016-2183, and the OpenVPN
vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2016-6329.
</p>

<p><strong>OpenVPN</strong> <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-announce@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00000.html">2.3.12</a> will <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00029.html">display</a> a
<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00030.html">warning</a> to users who choose to use 64-bit ciphers and encourage them
to transition to AES (cipher
negotiation is also being implemented in the 2.4 branch). It will also
implement a default
renegotiation limit of 64MB when used in TLS mode in a future version.  A <a href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32">wiki entry</a> provides further details.</p>

<p><strong>OpenSSL</strong> has moved 3DES ciphersuites from the
HIGH category to
MEDIUM in the <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e95f5e03f6f1f8d3f6cbe4b7fa48e57b4cf8fd60">1.0.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/0fff5065884d5ac61123a604bbcee30a53c808ff">1.0.2</a> branches, and will disable it by default in
the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/ef28891bab7054667f2f6739f6d376c38b3ca1cc">1.1.0</a> release.
They have a <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/">blog entry</a> with further details.</p>

<p><strong>Akamai</strong> will offer an option for web server
administrators to drop 3DES
from the offered ciphers.</p>

<p><strong>Apple</strong> has disabled 3DES on icloud.com and is
recommending that
all its customers disable 3DES on their websites. </p>

<p>
Currently, most browsers see about 1% of their connections using
3DES, and vendors consider this number too high to simply disable
3DES on the client side, since too many websites would be broken.
So, they are instead considering implementing data limits per
connection to force rekeying, or offering 3DES ciphersuites only in a
fallback negotiation if no AES ciphersuite is acceptable to the
server.
</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla</strong> is implementing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1268745">data limits</a> for all
ciphersuites.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3155527.aspx">removed</a> 3DES from the False Start
whitelist.</p>

<p>
More details about implemented countermeasures
will be added to this webpage as they become
available.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<div class="item-body">

  <h3>Why is 3DES still used with a modern browser?</h3>

  <p>Because more than 1% of the web servers are poorly configured, and prefer using 3DES rather than AES.</p>

  <h3>How can I check if my server is well configured?</h3>

  <p>You can use
  the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">scanning tool</a>
  form Qualys SSL Labs.  In the "Handshake Simulation" section, you
  should see 3DES or RC4 only with browsers that don't support
  stronger ciphersuites, like IE6/XP and IE8/XP.  If you have 3DES
  ciphersuites at the bottom of the "Cipher Suites" section, you can
  try to remove them, but it's not an immediate security issue.
  Removing 3DES will protect you against potential downgrade attack,
  but it will also break connections from older clients.</p>

  <h3>How can I fix my server's configuration</h3>

  <p>You can follow the advice
  from <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">Mozilla</a>,
  and their <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/">Configuration generator</a>.</p>

  <h3>I'm using Blowfish-256, is it safe?</h3>

  <p>No, the attack is independent of the key length.  It work on
  Blowfish with any key length, and Triple-DES with 3 independent keys
  (168 bits in total).</p>

  <h3>Why Sweet32?</h3>

  <p>
    It's a stupid pun, based on
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_sixteen_%28birthday%29">sweet
    sixteen</a> birthday celebration.  Our attack is a birthday
    attack (taking its name from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday paradox</a>) with complexity 2<sup>32</sup>.  You could also say that
    2<sup>32</sup> is the <i>sweet spot</i> where attacks become practical.
