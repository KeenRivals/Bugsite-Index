# Overview

The goal of this project is to maintain a list of bug websites such as [Heartbleed.com](http://heartbleed.com). Contributions welcome!

# Websites

* [Backronym.fail](http://backronym.fail/) – allows for an attacker to downgrade and snoop on the SSL/TLS connection that MySQL client libraries use to communicate to a MySQL server.
* [Badlock.org](http://badlock.org/) – MITM attack for samba in an Active Directory environment.
* [BreachAttack.com](http://breachattack.com/) – HTTPS information leak by compression. Related to CRIME.
* [DrownAttack.com](https://drownattack.com/) – attacks servers supporting modern TLS protocol suites by using their support for the obsolete, insecure, SSL v2 protocol.
* [Factorable.net](https://factorable.net/) – widespread weak keys in network devices.
* [FreakAttack.com](https://freakattack.com/) – allows an attacker to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and servers and force them to use weakened encryption
* [GoToFail.com](https://gotofail.com/) – certain Apple iOS versions did not check TLS certificate validity.
* [Heartbleed.com](http://heartbleed.com) – OpenSSL memory leak which could leak private keys.
* [httpoxy.org](https://httpoxy.org/) – insecure handling of HTTP proxy environment variable in CGI applications.
* [ImageTragick.com](https://imagetragick.com/) – remote code execution in imagemagick via user-submitted images.
* [Poodle.io](https://poodle.io/) – allows MITM attacker to downgrade TLS connections and decrypt SSLv3 connections.
* [WeakDH.org](https://weakdh.org/) – applications which support DHE_EXPORT ciphers allow MITM via weak Diffie-Hellman keys.
